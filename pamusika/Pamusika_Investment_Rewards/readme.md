### Input Parameters

The following parameters are required to compute rewards for an individual customer:

- `cost_price`: The price at which Pamusika buys the product.
- `selling_price`: The price at which the product is sold to customers.
- `quantity_purchased`: The number of units purchased by the customer.

### Example Calculation

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the reward calculation functionality:

```python
cost_price = 0.60  # Cost price of tomatoes
selling_price = 1.00  # Selling price of tomatoes
quantity_purchased = 10  # Quantity purchased

# Calculate profit and rewards
profit_per_unit = calculate_profit(cost_price, selling_price)
total_profit = profit_per_unit * quantity_purchased
reward_percentage = get_reward_percentage(total_profit / (cost_price * quantity_purchased))
total_reward = calculate_reward(total_profit, reward_percentage)

print(f"Total Reward for Customer: ${total_reward:.2f}")
```

### Output
